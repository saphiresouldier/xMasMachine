*Gameplay:* 

The game is about the Christmas Factory of Santa Claus where Santas Little Helpers are busy creating toys as presents for children. The gameplay is inspired by local coop games like overcooked, where the players work together towards a common goal but each is in the others way and there's a lot of communication (or rather ... shouting at each other) between the players. 2 - 4 players can play together at one time, using the same keyboard as input device. 

The game is taking place inside Santas toy factory where the players are controlling Santas little helpers. The goal of the game is to manufacture the toys passing by on the conveyor belt without missing one before it leaves the room (Or otherwise Santa is getting really angry and taking away one of your 3 precious hearts - lose all and it's Game Over for you!). 

A toy is manufactured by typing the letters displayed above the toy - **But from left to right** ! There's no special order in which the currently passing by toys have to be manufactured, the players have to decide on an order, otherwise it might geht very chaotic...
